Target:

Use Regularization, Dropout and Image Augmentation (Image rotation) and adjust learning rate to get Test Accuracy of 99.4% in 15 Epochs

Results:

Parameters: 8,220

Best Train Accuracy: 98.99 (14th Epoch)

Best Test Accuracy: 99.41 (14th Epoch)

Analysis:

We are able to achieve Test accuracy of 99.41 in 14th Epoch but it is not consistent


final Result
